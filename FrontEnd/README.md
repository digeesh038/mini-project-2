(‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ) **It takes a hot minute (1~2 mins) to load the site**, why ? well, render drops all the resources after 15 mins of no incoming traffic. And, I am quite sure you're probably the first one visiting the site in weeks  ( well, technically i do stare into this void of a site every morning, don't ask me why ) .
